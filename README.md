# Attribute Segmentation of New Jersey State Vehicle Crash Data
[Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project]

This repository contains the files for my Machine Learning capstone project. The goal of this project was using K-Means clustering algorithms to identify crash patterns across New Jersey municipalities by crash attribute segmentation.

## Libraries Used
The libraries used in this project are all native to Python 3.8 and indicated in the import statements in each Juypter notebook.

## Additional Material
Supporting material is found in the Additional Materials folder which includes all images of component makeup charts, attribute value heatmaps, cluster makeup Excel, raw data before pre-processing, and normalized dataset used to train the PCA and K-means model.
