# Attribute Segmentation of New Jersey State Vehicle Crash Data
[Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project]

This repository contains the files for my Machine Learning (ML) capstone project. The goal of this project was using K-Means clustering algorithms to identify crash patterns across New Jersey municipalities by crash attribute segmentation using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Additionally, this project also compares PCA and clustering results between Amazon Sagemaker and Scikit-learn to identify any differences between the two ML libraries.

### Data Source and Processing
Crash data is publicilly avaliable on the New Jersey Department of Transportation website. The data contains over 5 million crash data points, each with over

### Technologies & Libraries Used
This project utilizes Jupyter Notebooks with Python 3.8 to perform all data analysis and ML tasks. The two ML libraries used are:
1. **Amazon Sagemaker**: an open source ML library for Python integration. Training models uses Amazon's cloud servers and incurs a fee for training time and uptime.
2. **SciKit-learn**: a free ML library that is easily imported in any Python enviornment. Training models is free and dependent on your hardware.

### Additional Materials
Supporting material is found in the Additional Materials folder which includes all images of component makeup charts, attribute value heatmaps, cluster makeup Excel, raw data before pre-processing, and normalized dataset used to train the PCA and K-means model.
